K24 -- Cold LAMPin w Flav/Virtual machines with digital ocean/Setting them up with users, linux, apache, sqlite, and python

time spent: 1

My initial attempt to create a droplet was unsuccessful after realizing that when I re-entered the system via ssh, I entered the root and installed apache, python, and sqlite from there rather than from the user account.
Would this have been a fatal error? Running the commands via sudo may have done the same thing
Editing the file to remove root login was also difficult
I was unsure of how to open the file, but I was able to use vim to open it and insert mode allowed me to make the edit, although it did give a warning about changing a read-only file.
