K22 -- Who does Frame work for? (Framework assignment, explaining foundation)
2021-11-30
time spent: <.8 (in class)>
Foundation docs: https://get.foundation/frameworks-docs.html
Foundation requires a LOT of div classes.
The cell and grid system were a bit confusing at first, but appear to be quite useful.
Forms look very nice.
Buttons are simple and work well.
