K12 -- How templates work in flask and how @app.route creates a new page with a new link
2021-10-7
app.py
#Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
It won't render the template (test_tmplt() will return an error if we were to remove render_template.
Result: The error is only returned if we go to the /my_foist_template link, as the default webpage function does not use a render_template function. The webpage itself displays the error.

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
It will load as https://localhost:5000/path/my_foist_template
Edit: https://localhost:5000/my_foist_template (no path!)

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
The first arg ("model_tmplt.html" selects the template file, foo = "foooo" makes it the title of the website, collection makes the collection variable in the model_tmplt equal to the coll list defined in app.py.
