Function info:
*Can access o and subsequent attributes from terminal with o.attribute
*addItem added the text at the bottom of the list
*removeItem removed the item at the given index
*red made everything red
*stripe made things alternate red and blue

Calling stripe and red multiple times had inconsistent results with things that were already colored. I assume this occured because we simply add to html tags, so the tag becomes something like "red blue blue red" and it just stays blue or red.
